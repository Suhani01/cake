Preheat the oven to 350Â° F.  

Butter and flour the round cake pans you have chosen to use. To be sure my cakes release easily from the tin, I line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper. For best results, grease the pans, add the parchment paper to the bottom, grease again, then flour.  

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or with hand beaters, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.  

Beat the softened butter into the dry mixture until it is in tiny crumbs resembling sand well dispersed in the flour mixture.   

In a large measuring cup or small bowl, briefly whisk together the the oil, eggs, yogurt, and vanilla. Pour the wet mixture into the dry. Beat until incorporated.  

Pour in the milk and mix until smooth. The batter should be quite thin.   

Divide the cake batter among the prepared pans.  

Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the cakes are lightly browned and spring back when lightly pressed. Keep in mind that all ovens are different and that the amount of cake pans you choose affect baking time.   

Cool in the tin for 15 mins, and then take the cakes out and cool completely on the rack before icing. You may need to run a knife around the edges to help release the cake.
